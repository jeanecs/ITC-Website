            <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>
                One of the most important components of a computer is the motherboard, which essentially acts as the nervous system, 
                connecting and coordinating all parts of the system in much the same way as the nervous system does for the human body. 
                A motherboard is a printed circuit board that holds key elements like the computer’s memory, timing, and control functions, 
                along with input and output capabilities <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-12-068377-2.x5000-1" target="blank">(Austerlitz, 2003)</a>. It integrates all the essential parts needed for the computer 
                to operate, enabling communication between the CPU, memory, storage, and peripheral devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                While all motherboards serve a similar purpose, specific tasks, and performance demands call for specialized features
                 and capabilities. As a result, different motherboard designs exist to meet various requirements for functionality, 
                 compatibility, and overall performance when building a computer tailored for particular uses. This comparative analysis 
                 will examine different types of motherboards, focusing on their unique features, specializations, and how effectively 
                 they fulfill their intended purposes.
            </p>
            <h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>
            <p>
                As computers have evolved to fulfill specialized roles, motherboards have diversified in design, offering various form 
                factors that support different requirements. These form factors, including AT, ATX, BTX, Extended-ATX, LPX, Micro-ATX, 
                Mini-ITX, Mini-ATX, Pico-BTX, and Standard-ATX, each define specific dimensions and component layouts to meet unique needs
                <a href="https://inpo.khsu.ru/files/College/science/konf/materialyinpk2015.pdf#page=235" target="blank">(Поликарпова, 2015)</a>. In this discussion, we’ll explore how these form factors impact the functionality and suitability of 
                 different motherboards for various applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we now have many efficient motherboard form factors, it all began with the Advanced Technology (AT) motherboard, 
                designed by IBM in 1984. While no longer common in modern computing, the AT motherboard significantly shaped the history of 
                motherboard design and laid the groundwork for later advancements. It typically featured serial and parallel ports, a single 
                soldered keyboard connector, and SIMM slots positioned at the top of the board. However, the AT design had notable drawbacks, 
                including a cramped layout that often caused interference between connectors and expansion cards, inefficient cooling due to 
                poor airflow, and a tendency to accumulate dust, necessitating regular cleaning <a href="https://www.meridianoutpost.com/resources/articles/atx-vs-at-form-factor.php#TOC" target="blank"></a>(Illustrated Overview of Motherboard Form Factors 
                [ATX, ETAX, Mini-itx, BLX, and More], n.d.)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AT form factor was eventually replaced by the more efficient ATX standard in 1995, addressing many of its predecessor's issues. 
                The ATX motherboard, a standard-sized form factor, is widely used in desktop builds due to its well-balanced features and compatibility 
                with high-performance components. It typically supports 2-3 GPUs, multiple RAM slots, numerous SATA ports, and effective cooling options, 
                making it a favorite among gamers and enthusiasts <a href="https://whatintech.com/motherboard-size-guide/" target="blank">(Ross, 2024)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ATX motherboard features dimensions of 12.0 x 7.6 inches, supporting LGA CPU slots and up to four DDR3 memory slots. It 
                typically uses Intel's Z77 chipset, which provides flexible BIOS options with UEFI for system management. PCIe slots enable high-performance 
                expansions, while SATA 6.0 Gb/s ports ensure fast storage connections <a href="https://arrow.tudublin.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=schmuldissoft" target="blank">(Casey, 2015)</a>. Variants of the ATX motherboard include Micro-ATX, Mini-ITX, Mini-ATX, 
                and eXtended ATX (e-ATX), which primarily differ in size and expansion capabilities. For instance, the Micro-ATX measures 9.6 x 9.6 inches, and the 
                Mini-ITX measures 6.7 x 6.7 inches. These smaller sizes are ideal for those needing compact systems while maintaining a balance between size and 
                expandability. Full-sized motherboards tend to be more expensive, making the mini variants a budget-friendly option with similar upgrade possibilities. 
                The Mini-ATX, measuring about 11.2 x 8.2 inches, serves as a middle ground, being smaller than the standard ATX but larger than the Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX 
                form factors <a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/glossary/mini-atx/?orgRef=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F" target="blank">(Mini-ATX: Compact Power for Efficient Builds | Lenovo US, 2023)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, if performance is the top priority, larger variants like the e-ATX motherboards are especially useful. These motherboards are designed to accommodate more powerful PC setups, offering more space for 
                expansion cards and the ability to house higher-performance components compared to smaller form factors. The e-ATX is ideal for users looking for exceptional performance, 
                as it supports overclocking and allows for more extensive customizations. However, they tend to be more expensive than standard motherboards, and may not be necessary for 
                users who don’t need to utilize all of their advanced capabilities <a href="https://www.electronicshub.org/atx-vs-eatx-motherboard/" target="blank">(Teja, 2024)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, the Balanced Technology Extended (BTX) motherboard was introduced as a successor to the ATX form factor, designed to address the thermal management challenges of modern computer systems. 
                Unlike the ATX, BTX features an optimized layout that enhances airflow, with components arranged to ensure smoother cooling. BTX also has a smaller variant, the Pico-BTX motherboard, which measures 8 × 10.5 inches. 
                This version includes an additional expansion slot and is tailored for specialized applications, such as riser cards and half-height setups. While BTX and ATX motherboards initially shared many similarities, BTX 
                later adopted a mirrored layout, positioning components on the left side instead of the right, effectively flipping its orientation compared to the ATX" (<a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/1440/1/199/817760/Computational-analysis-of-heat-flow-in-computer" target="blank">Azwadi et al., 2012</a>; <a href="https://www.eetimes.com/btx-computer-motherboard-power-management-solutions/#:~:text=Figure%202%20illustrates%20three%20types,and%20one%205.25%E2%80%B3%20drive%20bay." target="blank">Bailley & Lakkas, 2004</a>; 
                <a href="https://eiratek.com/different-types-of-motherboard/?srsltid=AfmBOoohkRZscWmG8vElPTd7--rA6adIpcWS0tBhniFT_uMQEAMQ0HhZ" target="blank">Eiratek, 2018</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the Low-Profile Extended (LPX) motherboard is a compact form factor designed for desktop PCs. It is characterized by expansion boards mounted parallel to the motherboard using a riser card. The LPX motherboard was created to fit into compact, low-profile cases, with the goal of saving space and reducing costs. However, it has since been replaced by the NLX form factor due to its lack of an accelerated graphics port (AGP), which required direct PCI connections instead 
                (<a href="https://pubs.aip.org/aip/acp/article-abstract/1440/1/199/817760/Computational-analysis-of-heat-flow-in-computer" target="_blank">Pirillo & Taylor, 2004</a>;

            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, motherboards have drastically changed over time to keep up with the needs of modern computers and technological advancement. The AT form factor, while important in the past, had issues like being too big and hard to cool. It was replaced by ATX, which fixed many of those problems and became a popular choice for most computer builds. Smaller versions like Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX are great for compact setups, while larger ones like e-ATX are perfect for powerful systems that need more space for extra components. Other designs, like BTX, tried to solve cooling issues but didn’t last long because they weren’t as widely adopted. The LPX form factor focused on saving space but was eventually replaced because it couldn’t support newer technology. Overall, the evolution of motherboard form factors shows how they adapt to meet different needs, from saving space to boosting performance. Each type plays a role in shaping the computers we use today.
