            <h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>Computers have become essential to modern life, progressing from basic calculating machines to advanced tools that power 
                innovation and shape industries. The evolution began with Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine in 1871, a pioneering 
                invention that laid the groundwork for contemporary technology <a href="http://britannica.com/technology/Analytical-Engine" target="blank">(Freiberger & Swaine, 2024)</a>. 
                Over time, computers have been designed in various forms and with specific capabilities to address the diverse needs of users across 
                different fields. This analysis examines the distinctions among types of computers, highlighting their features, strengths, and the 
                roles they play in meeting unique demands. Specifically, we will examine processing speed, memory capacity, power consumption, and 
                usage requirements to understand better these differences and their implications for the current state of computing</p>
            <h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>
            <p>This analysis explores six types of computers: supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers,
                 workstations, and servers. Each type serves distinct purposes across various sectors of society, 
                 including private organizations and personal use. Supercomputers, for instance, are highly advanced 
                 and powerful machines designed to perform large-scale scientific and engineering tasks due to their 
                 immense computational power and speed. A common application of supercomputers includes climate and weather 
                 prediction, as well as studying cosmic evolution. What sets them apart from other types of computers is their 
                 use of multiple CPUs, enabling unparalleled processing capabilities <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/supercomputer" target="blank">(Hosch, 2024)</a>.</p>
            <p>Next are mainframe computers, powerful machines designed for centralized data storage, software management, and 
                processing capabilities<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/mainframe-computer" target="blank">(Wheeler & Winburn, 2015)</a>. While supercomputers surpass mainframes in raw 
                computational power, mainframes are better suited for institutions requiring reliable transaction 
                processing and data management, such as banks, healthcare facilities, and government services. 
                Additionally, mainframe computers are generally more affordable and smaller in size, making them a 
                practical choice compared to supercomputers.
            </p>
            <p>Server computers, in contrast to supercomputers and mainframe computers, are highly scalable and designed to
                 manage data, devices, and systems across a network <a href="https://www.spiceworks.com/tech/tech-general/articles/what-is-a-server/" target="blank">(Kanade, 2023)</a>. While supercomputers and mainframes 
                 excel in raw processing and calculating power, server computers are designed to provide specialized 
                 services such as hosting websites, processing emails, and managing complex workloads like database 
                 transactions. Though they may not match the computational power of supercomputers and mainframes, 
                 servers are crucial for efficiently managing networked systems and providing resources to client devices. 
                 Their ability to scale up or down based on demand makes them ideal for businesses and organizations 
                 requiring flexibility and reliable service management.
            </p>
            <p>Supercomputers, mainframe computers, and server computers are all examples of advanced machines 
                designed to perform billions of operations and tasks within a short time with immense computational 
                power. On the other hand, other types of computers, such as minicomputers, microcomputers, and 
                workstations, are typically used at an organizational level for more specific or private purposes. 
                The key distinction between these two groups lies in their field of use. High-performance computers 
                are often employed in enterprise environments or specialized fields, while minicomputers, 
                microcomputers, and workstations serve distinct purposes based on their architecture, processing 
                power, use cases, and costs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Workstation computers are designed for single-user applications, capable of handling advanced graphics, 
                large storage, and powerful processing. Due to their high performance, workstations are commonly used in 
                fields such as engineering, science, and business applications, as they support high-resolution graphics
                 and multitasking <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/workstation" target="blank">(Kanade, 2023)</a>. Workstations are generally faster and more powerful than average 
                 personal computers. Compared to supercomputers, mainframes, and servers, workstation computers are much
                 smaller, can fit in personalized spaces, and are more versatile in their use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, we have the minicomputer, a smaller version of the average personal computer. Designed for 
                organizational tasks, the minicomputer handles mid-range functions such as managing business 
                transactions and controlling manufacturing processes. While it has less processing power than a 
                workstation computer, which handles more complex tasks involving graphics and intensive computations, 
                minicomputers enable efficient computing without the need for a mainframe. They are commonly used for 
                scientific experiments, network servers, file management, database tasks, engineering computations, 
                and even entertainment and creative work <a href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/minicomputer/" target="blank">(Beal, 2022)</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, the microcomputer, a term used to describe a computer system designed for personal use, is typically 
                smaller than both mainframe and minicomputers <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/microcomputer" target="blank">(Wright & Shea, 2024)</a>. The primary difference between a 
                microcomputer and a minicomputer lies in their architecture and performance capabilities. A minicomputer
                uses multiple processors to handle more complex tasks, whereas a microcomputer is built around a single 
                microprocessor as its CPU, making it more suited for simpler, individual tasks <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/microcomputer" target="blank">(Britannica, 2024)</a>. 
                An example of a microcomputer would be an iPhone, which is a smaller, mobile device yet still capable 
                of handling tasks such as internet browsing, communication, and various applications. Despite its 
                compact size, it can perform tasks that were once limited to much larger, more powerful computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, different types of computers (supercomputers, mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers, workstations, 
                and servers) serve distinct roles based on their computing power and purpose. Supercomputers are known for handling complex 
                tasks like scientific research, while mainframes are ideal for centralized data management in large organizations. Servers 
                provide flexibility and scalability for managing networks and services. Minicomputers and workstations cater to 
                specific needs such as business operations and engineering, while microcomputers offer personal, compact computing 
                for everyday tasks. Each type plays an important role in supporting the technological infrastructure that powers both 
                specialized and everyday functions.
